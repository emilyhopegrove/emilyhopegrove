### Hi there 👋

# My Journey into Software Engineering 👩‍💻

Welcome to my software engineering adventure! 🚀 In this readme, I'll take you through my transition from the world of digital marketing to the realm of coding. Buckle up for a tale of growth, challenges, and a passion for technology with a sprinkle of emojis along the way! 😊

## Personal Story and Impact 🌟

My journey from digital marketing to software engineering has been quite a ride. 🎢 Starting out in digital marketing (I was an SEO Writer & Strategist for [The Money Manual](https://www.themoneymanual.com/author/emily-grove)
, I was on the frontlines, seeing how technology affects people every day. It was all about understanding the user: what they want, how they feel, and what makes them click. That's where my love for the human side of tech began. 💖

Making the jump to software engineering felt like coming home in a strange way. If marketing is telling the story of tech, engineering is writing that story. 📝 And while they seem worlds apart, they both revolve around people. It’s like two sides of the same coin. 💰

At work, I bring this dual perspective. I see tech not just as lines of code but as solutions that make real differences in people’s lives. 💡 And I’m excited to bring this viewpoint to a platform all about making meaningful connections. 🌐

Switching careers was no walk in the park. There were countless hours spent learning, late-night coding sessions, and times when I felt way out of my depth. But every hiccup taught me something valuable. It wasn’t just about the tech; it was about pushing through, even when things got tough. 💪

I won’t lie; there were moments of self-doubt. Diving into a world filled with tech wizards was intimidating. But my background reminded me that everyone has their own strengths. I might be the new kid on the block in engineering, but I bring a unique blend of skills to the table. 🌟

This journey has been all about growth. Every challenge, a learning moment. Every setback, a chance to bounce back stronger. I’m committed to bringing this spirit to LinkedIn, melding my past with my future ambitions, and always keeping users at the heart of everything I do. As Katie Jeans from the LinkedIn Marketing department, and my former digital marketing instructor always said, "I can do hard things"! 💪

## My Journey into Programming 🚀

My route to programming was somewhat serendipitous. While navigating the world of digital marketing, I became increasingly intrigued by the technological underpinnings of the campaigns I managed. Every time I encountered a tech snag or limitation, I found myself wishing I could dive into the code and address it directly. Over time, this curiosity grew into a full-blown passion. I began to see programming not just as a means to an end but as an art—a blend of logic, creativity, and boundless possibility. It was this realization that led me to pivot, to explore a world where I could create the very solutions I once wished existed. 🌌

My drive to become a programmer was matched by a commitment to equip myself with the right skills. Hackbright Academy was my launchpad. 🚀 As a bootcamp focused on ushering more Women+ into software engineering, it was more than just a learning experience. It was an empowering journey where I was surrounded by like-minded individuals, all rallying toward a common goal. The curriculum was rigorous, demanding, yet deeply rewarding. From conceptualizing a full-stack application to understanding the intricacies of databases, Hackbright provided a comprehensive foundation. 💪

However, it was my stint as a Backend Engineering Intern at Bitly that truly transformed this foundation into practical expertise. Those 20 weeks were a deep dive into real-world coding challenges. Every project, every task was an opportunity to apply what I'd learned and further hone my skills. More importantly, the experience highlighted the profound impact of backend development—how robust, scalable solutions can power transformative user experiences. 🌐

Looking ahead, my commitment to growth is unwavering. While bootcamps and internships have provided a strong base, mastering coding is a continuous journey. I intend to regularly engage in online courses, attend workshops, and possibly mentor newcomers, passing on what I've learned. But beyond the skills, it's the mindset of lifelong learning that I cherish. My long-term goals include not only becoming a seasoned developer but also a catalyst for change in the tech landscape, championing diversity and user-centricity. 🌍

## My Engineering Talent - Project Overviews
### Backend
My time at Bitly, focusing on backend development, illuminated the immense potential of this domain. It’s the engine room of any application, and getting it right is paramount. I'm interested in the intricacies, the problem-solving nature, and the sheer satisfaction of creating resilient systems that users may never see, but will undoubtedly feel. 🛠️

Projects I've tackled, such as the Microsite Detail Page and Group Link-in-Bio Admin Table, are testaments to my growing proficiency and interest in backend. These projects underscored the importance of efficiency, security, and scalability. Furthermore, courses I took at Hackbright, emphasizing database management and server-side scripting, only solidified this passion. 📊

### Frontend
The interaction with the users and making their journey through whatever funnel work makes my heart sing. I love to know that what I'm working on directly will help them solve their problem! During my internship at Bitly, one of the projects that I am exceptionally proud to have worked on is the recent Link-in-bio Share feature, which has resulted in a remarkable 23% surge in non-paid traffic to the link-in-bio landing page post-deployment over a 2 week period! 📈

The Link-in-bio Share feature introduced a user-friendly share button integrated into live link-in-bios, streamlining content sharing on social platforms and email without having to navigate away from the initial page. This enhancement not only simplified the user experience but also fostered a safer online space by encouraging the reporting of abusive content more effortlessly. 🚀

Though I didn’t initiate the project, I played a pivotal role in bringing it to completion. The project was already in an impressive state thanks to the foundations laid by my colleague Leslie Chan. Leveraging the groundwork, I was able to enhance functionality significantly, steering it over the finish line. One of my main contributions was fine-tuning the feature to make it intuitive and user-centric, ensuring that the share menu was not only functional but also fluid and intuitive to use. 💻

This initiative started as a hack week project with the objective to enhance user experience by facilitating content sharing directly from the link-in-bio page and concurrently promoting a safer online environment. To understand further the scope of the project, here is an overview of the project: [Link-in-bio Share Overview](https://paschen.me/share-recording). 📺

Ultimately, it's about making meaningful impacts. The backend is where the magic happens, and I'm eager to be at the forefront, creating solutions that not only work seamlessly but elevate user experiences. Given my journey so far, and my tangible experiences both at Hackbright and Bitly, I believe I'm well-positioned to thrive as a Backend Apprentice Engineer and contribute meaningfully to LinkedIn’s mission. 🌟
